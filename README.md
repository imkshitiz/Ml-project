This is a machine learning project on fake news detection 
In our society, fake news has emerged as a pervasive and urgent problem, especially in the digital age. Fake news has the potential to spread quickly and affect public opinion, beliefs, and behaviour due to the extensive availability of social media platforms and the simplicity with which information may be distributed. Therefore, identifying false news is a crucial issue with significant ramifications for how democratic societies operate.

Because machine learning can automatically recognize patterns and relationships in data, it has become a viable method for identifying fake news. For this goal, a number of machine learning algorithms, including conventional approaches based on feature engineering, have been presented in recent years. 

In this research, we examine cutting-edge methods for machine learning-based fake news identification. We start by giving a general overview of the issue of fake news and how it affects society.

The detection of fake news is a topic of research for numerous academics. In this aspect, machine learning is proving to be beneficial. Machine learning algorithms are developed with this end in mind.
Once educated, machine learning algorithms will be able to recognize fake news on their own
